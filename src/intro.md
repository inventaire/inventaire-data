The Inventaire project has two pilars:

* The [book sharing web application](https://inventaire.io/welcome), inviting anyone to make the inventory of their books, and helping them to share those
* The open data project aiming at building a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)-centered database on resources, to support the needs of the web app, while being enriched by its users, and more broadly  speaking, to concretize our mission: mapping resources with libre software and open knowledge, starting with books.

This page centralizes resources for people interested in this second aspect, attempting to make clear **how to contribute to and re-use the bibliographic database**
