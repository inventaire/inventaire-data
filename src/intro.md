The Inventaire project has two pilars:

* The [book sharing web application](https://inventaire.io/welcome), inviting you to make the inventory of your books, and of the possibilities you want to open for them (giving, sharing, selling), and who should be able to see them (shared publicly, or just to your friends and groups).
* The open data project aiming at building a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)-centered database on resources, to support the needs of the web app, while being enriched by its users, and more broadly  speaking, to concretize our mission: mapping resources with libre software and open knowledge, starting with books.

This page centralizes resources for people interested in this second aspect, attempting to make clear **how to contribute to and re-use the bibliographic database**
