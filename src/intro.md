The Inventaire project has **two cores working in synergy**:

* **A [book sharing webapp](https://inventaire.io/welcome)**, inviting everyone to make the inventory of their books, define what they want to do with it (giving, sharing, selling), as well as who should be able to see it (shared publicly, or only visible to your friends and groups).
* **An open data project** aiming at building a [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org)-centered database. It supports needs for the webapp while being enriched by its users. More broadly it concretizes Inventaire mission: mapping resources with libre software and open knowledge, starting with books.

This page centralizes resources for people interested in this second core by presenting some way on **how to contribute and re-use the bibliographic database**
